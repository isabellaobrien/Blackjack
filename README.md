## How to pay
This terminal game is based on the blackjack casino game. Link to find out more.

In this version the user inputs their username and two cards for the player and two for the computer are drawn from a shuffled deck.
The player can see both of their cards but only the computer’s first card.

If the user or the computer don’t score a blackjack in the first hand, the player will be asked if they want to draw another card. The computer only draws another card if the score is less than 16. 
The game ends when someone scores a blackjack. Or when someone’s score is above 21 and if both scores are below 21 the person with the highest score wins.
